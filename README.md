# Applied Epi sample code
Sample code to support my application to the Applied Epi instructors rota.

In this sample code I will present an original practical-style Rmd that could be used as part of a workshop on basic and advanced applications of R to analyse epidemiological data. Download both files in `sample_code` and store them in a same folder.

I am writing this as if directed to attendees to an Applied Epi workshop, in support to my application to enter the rota of Applied Epi instructors. 

I will demonstrate the application of:

* Basic R functions for data manipulation and visualisation
* The use of `tidyverse` and other R packages for data manipulation, advanced visualisation and regression analysis

Many thanks in advance for your consideration.
